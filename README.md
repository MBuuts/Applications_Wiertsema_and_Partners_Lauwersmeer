# Skimming the surface: Analysis of vegetation stress in Lauwersmeer using remote sensing techniques 

This repository contains all reports, data, and scripts created by students from Wageningen University & Research commissioned by Wiertsema & Partners to analyze vegetation stress in the Lauwersmeer area using remote sensing techniques.

## ViWi App - LandTrendr NDVI time series comparison

**This tool can be used to compute and visualize NDVI time series of a single Landsat pixel, an imported shapefile or drawn polygons.**

The scripts in the `/data/GEE_scripts/...` folder of this repository facilitate interactively running the LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery) algorithms for clicked pixels, imported shapefiles or drawn polygons resulting in time series charts of NDVI. This repository folder includes three scripts (`LandTrendAPP.js`, `LandTrendr-UI.js`, and `LandTrendr.js`).

**Getting started:**

***The application of Davey: [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/7d8603473ab915baa475b892deab9147)***

The tool packaged as a Google Earth Engine App can be found [here](url to Earth Engine App). A step-by-step manual (including download link) on how to use the application can be found [here](link to manual). 

Alternatively, if you want to access the tool's source code, you can add the repository to your Google Earth Engine scripts by clicking [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/mariekebuuts97/Test2), it will be displayed in the Reader section. The visualization tool is accessible by running `LandTrendAPP.js`.   
_Note: scipts in the Reader section cannot be modified. Access to modifiable scripts will be given to the Google Earth Engine account of Wiertsema & Partners._

***Description of what LandTrendr.js and LandTrendr-UI.js are about. Can just be a short description.***  
Additional LandTrendr utilities are included in `LandTrendr.js` and a description of the original LandTrendr utilities can be found [here](https://emapr.github.io/LT-GEE/). 


## Reports

Project deliverables can be found in the `/reports/...` folder of this repository. This folder includes four files (`manual.pdf`, `report.pdf`, `proposal.pdf`, and `dmp.pdf`). `Report.pdf` contains...
