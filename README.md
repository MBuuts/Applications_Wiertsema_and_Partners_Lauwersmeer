# ViWi App - LandTrendr NDVI time series comparison

**This tool can be used to compute and visualize NDVI time series of a single Landsat pixel, an imported shapefile or drawn polygons.**

The scripts in this repository facilitate interactively running the LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery) algorithms for clicked pixels, imported shapefiles or drawn polygons resulting in time series charts of NDVI. This repository includes three scripts (`LandTrendAPP.js`, `LandTrendr-UI.js`, and `LandTrendr.js`).

**Getting started:**

The tool packaged as a Google Earth Engine App can be found [here](url to Earth Engine App).

Alternatively, if you want to access the tool's source code, you can add the repository to your Google Earth Engine scripts by clicking [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/mariekebuuts97/Test2), it will be dispalyer in the Reader section. The visualization tool is accessible by running `LandTrendAPP.js`. 

_Note: scipts in the Reader section cannot be modified. Access to modifiable scripts will be given to the Google Earth Engine account of Wiertsema & Partners._

Parameters for the LandTrendr algorithms can be adjusted in the left-hand panel, and clicking the map, inserting a shapefile or drawing a polygon in the map will interactively display LandTrendr inputs and segmentation results for the selected pixel or area in a set of charts in the right-hand panel. 

Additional LandTrendr utilities are included in `LandTrendr.js` and a description of the original LandTrendr utilities can be found [here](https://emapr.github.io/LT-GEE/). A step-by-step manual (including download link) on how to use the application can be found [here](https://github.com/MBuuts/DORA_ViWi_App/blob/main/Manual%20(1).pdf). elaborate manual on how to use the ViWi App can be found [here](url to manual in repository).

## Collaboration Wiertsema & Partners

This tool was designed by students from Wageningen University & Research to assist Wiertsema & Partners in detecting vegetation stress and vegetation pattern changes in the Lauwersmeer area, the Netherlands.
